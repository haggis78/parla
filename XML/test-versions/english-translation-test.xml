This having been executed by customary means, was assigned to the Reverend Guardian Fathers, Prefect, and Missionaries because of their language comprehension to ensure a faithful translation by which the officers carried out their duties, and His Excellency addressing the four Butalmapus in the following manner stating:</ab></div>
            
    <div n="4"><ab>I have the greatest satisfaction, Main Caciques my Friends, to see all of you gathered at this Encampment today to celebrate the General Parlamento with the four Butalmapus that encompass the Land from the Bío- Bío River in the South, to the most southern Nations of the Continent, and from the Sea to the Cordillera. All of you have requested this with the utmost seriousness, for the good of Your Land. And His Excellency Señor Captain General of the Kingdom was eagerly looking forward to being present at this Port to ratify your obedience to our Grand Lord and King and to affirm all the Articles that would bring mutual happiness to both Nations. However, he has not been able to ratify it due to serious issues at the beginning of his Administration and other pending endeavors that have prevented him from being in attendance. Due to his legitimate reasons, he has kindly bestowed his authority on me so that on his behalf I preside over this Congress in order to advise all of you on what is convenient to advance your interests, civility, and obedience to the King as good Vassals placed under his highest protection.</ab></div>
            
            <div n="5"><ab>Now, as I have witnessed the situation in Your Countries when a few years ago I traveled through the Butalmapu of Angol to the Government of the Plaza of Valdivia, which was full of estates, cattle of all breeds, advanced agriculture, strong mozetones and families enjoying the tranquility and advantages that have been provided by the kindness of our beloved Sovereign who has dispensed all means and considerations for your well-being, and as I have been shown all due respect and possible deference, I am proud to preside over this Parlamento. I express my heartfelt disposition to provide all the help that is fair and beneficial for everyone under the rules and Articles that you put forth in this same place to his Excellency Señor Marquess of Osorno in the year ninety-three, as well as other Articles that may be suitable to discuss for your own benefit, addressing the happiness of the four Butalmapus, whose advantages have been proven by Brigadier Commander of the Dragoon Corps Don Pedro Nolazco del Río, who has governed you for so many years with the utmost wisdom, and who wishes to see you achieving the pinnacle of your well-being and civilization. I trust that you will willingly follow my recommendations and obey my commands. I greet you all on behalf of the King and ask you to be mindful of the issues stated in this Document which includes only what is advantageous to you.</ab></div>
    
    <div n="6"><ab>I am confident that as a result of your understanding of my character and heart, which is committed to your well-being, you will do everything to preserve the unity in which I find you, burying in oblivion all disagreements and animosity that the Reductions have previously held, strengthening the advantages hereby to bring about a general peace, that this Parlamento should mark a milestone from the distant past to your posterity, as the sole foundation of all your Agreements and of the protection of our Sovereign, of which you will be worthy by virtue of your subordination and obedience.</ab></div>
