            <h1>Geography and Maps</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>When historians organize our information, we consider chronology (events in historical order), topical analysis (grouping events by type to look for patterns), and 
               geography (how location influenced events, and how events affected different locations in different ways).</p>
            <p>Geography is often the least well-developed of the three in historical writing. This is, in part, because it can be difficult to describe, in the form of a linear narrative, 
               events that unfolded 
               in a three-dimensional landscape. But it is also because historical geography itself is difficult. Old maps, where they even exist, may have been 
               inaccurate or lacking in important details even when they were new. Textual sources can be vague or incorrect about locations: writers did not always know
               where places were. Even
            when they are not, the landscape is not as static as it seems. Roads may change their routes. Villages can move, or may stay in the same place but change names. 
            The borders of administrative districts may shift or may have been poorly defined. 
            Frontiers of control between neighboring peoples--such as between the Spaniards and the Mapuche, or among different Mapuche groups--are
            subject to endless contestation. Even the physical landscape changes: sea coasts erode, meandering rivers change their courses, floods wash land away from one place and pile up 
            the silt in another. All of these changes, and more that could be named, mean that using present-day maps or satellite photography to study the locations of past events
            presents difficulties.</p>
            <p>Being mindful of these challenges, this page is dedicated to presenting information on the locations of Parlamento meetings and the places mentioned in the documents 
            translated on this website.</p>
