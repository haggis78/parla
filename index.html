            <h2>Parlamentos as Process and Documents</h2>
            <p>From the seventeenth century to the nineteenth, the southern border of Chile was a
                complex frontier. Agents of the Spanish Empire, and after independence agents of the
                Chilean state, periodically met to negotiate with leaders of the Indigenous peoples
                of the region, particularly the Mapuche. These meetings were called
                    <i>Parlamentos</i>, and the treaties agreed at them are likewise called
                    <i>Parlamentos</i>.</p>
            <p>These treaties are historically significant. Nowhere else in the Americas was there
                such a sustained program of negotiation with, rather than mere conquest of,
                Indigenous peoples. The Chilean case thus has interest well beyond Chile as a
                demonstration of the range of possibilities for more positive Settler-Indigenous
                interactions that proved elusive in most other contexts.</p>
            <h2>The Parlamentos Project: Goals</h2>
            <p><i>Parlamentos</i> documents, despite their intrinsic historical, linguistic, and
                ethnographic interest, have attracted little sustained analysis. Only a few have
                ever been published as full texts, and even then only in their original and often
                challenging Castilian Spanish.</p>
            <p>This project is a born-digital edition and translation which, when complete, will
                include full Spanish text, English translation, and historical and linguistic
                commentary on six selected Parlamentos documents.</p>
            <p>The project is still in its early stages. The team was granted a Digital Humanities
                Planning Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities for the 2022-2023
                academic year to create a pilot version with a single document.</p>
